# Drowsiness Detection

This project focuses on detecting drowsiness using computer vision techniques. Leveraging the power of YOLOv8, the project aims to identify signs of drowsiness from visual input, enabling proactive measures to prevent fatigue-related accidents.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from [Roboflow: Detection Drowsiness](https://app.roboflow.com/deep-learing-p9dxb/detection-drowsiness). It contains labeled images specifically curated for detecting drowsiness-related features.

### Key Features of the Dataset:
- **Labels:** Includes annotated regions indicating signs of drowsiness.
- **Images:** A diverse set of images to ensure robust detection in various scenarios.


## Results

- The YOLOv8 model achieved high performance on the dataset, demonstrating robust detection capabilities.
